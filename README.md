The name of our project is 'INFOSPITAL'
Infospital is a platform where people can get information about different facilities
provided by the hospitals in their locality. Getting informed about number of vacant beds
before visiting to the hospital is really helpful, especially in current covid-19 scenario.

Health care is an indivisible part of our life. Getting up to date information about different 
health care facilities provided is need of the moment. INFOSPITAL helps all the people in our 
society to make important health related decisions by providing the necessary health related
information.

Hospitals and Doctors can join INFOSPITAL and register their details 
which can be accessed by all the people who wish to avail health care facilities.
The details can be updated by the Registrant so that patients can have knowledge
of current status of the services provided.
